## How it works

* ``World Constraint`` uses ``World.prefab`` from the assets as a parent constraint source. ``World.prefab`` is not in the scene, so ``World Constraint`` will always stay at position 0, 0, 0.
* The parent constraint on ``Container`` uses ``Reset Target`` as a source, which is used to bring ``Container`` to your avatar.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/World-Constraint/assets/76777936/464287a8-c43c-4cf0-bc6b-5ec700a3eb9b

* Drag & drop the ``World Constraint`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``Reset Target``
* Move ``Reset Target`` outside of ``World Constraint`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.

## How to use

* Place the objects you want to leave in world space inside ``World Constraint`` -> ``Container``.
  * Alternatively you can constrain the objects to ``Container``.
* Disable the ``Container`` parent constraint component to leave it in world space, and enable it to reset the ``Container`` to ``Reset Target``.

## Additional notes

* By default, the Container and its contents will not scale with your avatar. If you want the Container and its contents to scale with your avatar, add a Scale Constraint to the ``Container`` object, set your avatar as the source, and activate it.
* If your Reset Target is directly under your avatar, it won't properly rotate with you in full body.

## Performance stats

```c++
Constraints:        3
