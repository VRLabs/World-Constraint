## How it works

* "World Constraint" uses "World.prefab" as a parent constraint source. "World.prefab" is not in the scene, so "World Constraint" and it's child hierarchy will not move with the avatar.
* The parent constraint on "Container" uses "Reset Target" as a source, which is used to bring "Container" to your avatar.

## Install guide

* Drag & drop the ``World Constraint`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab, and locate "Reset Target". Move this object out of the prefab to anywhere else on your avatar.

## How to use

* Disable the "Container" parent constraint component to leave it in world space, and enable it to reset the "Container" to "Reset Target".

## Additional Notes

* By default, the Container and its contents will not scale with your avatar. If you want the Container and its contents to scale with your avatar, add a Scale Constraint to the "Container" object, set your avatar as the source, and activate it.
* If your Reset Target is directly under your avatar, it won't properly rotate with you in full body.

## Performance stats

```c++
Constraints:        3
```

## Hierarchy layout
